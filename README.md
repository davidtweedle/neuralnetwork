# Generic Neural Network #
--------------------------

## Introduction
This repository contains a neural network implemented in numpy.
It provides the following functionalities:
  - feedforward neural network layer with bias and dropout
  - ReLU or softmax for activation
  - cross entropy or residual sum of squares for loss function
  - layers can easily be stacked
  - adjustible batch size

## Installing
```
git clone https://github.com/davidtweedle/neuralnetwork.git
cd neuralnetwork
pip install .
```
